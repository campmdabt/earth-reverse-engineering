This is an attempt to reverse-engineer undocumented parts of Google Earth. The goal is to document the results and to provide code that emerges. Similar work is being done for Apple Maps [here](https://github.com/retroplasma/flyover-reverse-engineering).

#### Status
The focus has been on the 3D satellite mode, which required digging into:
- URL structures
- octrees and conversion from geo coordinates
- Protobuf formats of assets and metadata
- postprocessing steps (e.g. unpacking of meshes and textures)

Code was written and tested with various regions and cities:
- [Flycam client](./client/) (native + WebAssembly)
- [Model exporter](./exporter/) (works without photogrammetry or graphics debuggers)

#### Info

URL structure:
```
"https://kh.google.com/rt/üÖê/üÖë"
 - üÖê: planet
       - "earth"
       - "mars"
       - ...
 - üÖë: resource
       - "PlanetoidMetadata"
       - "BulkMetadata/pb=!1m2!1s‚ù∂!2u‚ù∑"
          - ‚ù∂: octant path
          - ‚ù∑: epoch
       - "NodeData/pb=!1m2!1s‚ù∏!2u‚ùπ!2e‚ù∫(!3u‚ùª)!4b0"
          - ‚ù∏: octant path
          - ‚ùπ: epoch
          - ‚ù∫: texture format
          - ‚ùª: imagery epoch (sometimes)
```

Misc:
```
General info:
 - Everything is stored in an octree.

Roles of resources:
 - PlanetoidMetadata points to first BulkMetaData.
 - BulkMetaData points to other BulkMetaData and to NodeData.
 - NodeData contains actual meshes and textures.

Versioning:
 - BulkMetaData and NodeData are versioned using epoch numbers.
 - PlanetoidMetadata provides epoch of first BulkMetaData.
 - BulkMetaData provides epochs of underlying resources.
 - Current version of a resource can be determined recursively.

NodeData:
 - Mesh: packed XYZ, UV, octant mask, normals
 - Texture: JPG, CRN-DXT1
 - Raw format: see rocktree.proto and rocktree_decoder.h
 - Other optimizations: BVH
BulkMetaData:
 - Oriented Bounding Box
    - Dump OBB to obj: https://gist.github.com/retroplasma/5698808bfaa63ffd03f751a84fa6ce14
    - Latlong to octant using OBB (unstable): https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering/blob/443a3622ce9cb12cd4460cc6dc7999cc703ae67f/experimental_latlong_to_octant.js
